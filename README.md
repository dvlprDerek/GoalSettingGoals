Introduction
With our teams’ shared passion for sport statistics, we thought it would be fun to create a NHL goal tracker with the idea of a “goal mountain” in mind. With that being said, we introduce the “Goal-setting goals”.

What it does
It allows the user to input 5 NHL players who played in the 2021-2022 season and then fetches their stats. After obtaining their stats, it visualizes their goals in a mountain where the highest number is 100% on the scale and at the peak, with the other players being scaled respectively. The use of the code should be pretty intuitive as you just have to follow the steps that are prompted by the code.

Future
In the future, we want to implement a more elegant user interface and user experience using a website or mobile app. With our limited experience in this space, we weren’t able to learn the necessary skills in time to implement it properly.
